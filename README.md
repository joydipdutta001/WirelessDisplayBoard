# iotprojects (IOT based SmartAlertSystem Having Wireless Message Display through an android app)

**-> This project is based on IoT concepts which is contains an Android App through which one can send his message to the particular display board.<br></br>
-> Each display board is consisting of Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Smoke Sensor, and a Buzzer(for the danger situations).<br></br>
-> Each Board can monitor the environmental conditions and also it will display the user's message. <br></br>
-> One can control more than one board through the app.(You will find video of the Display Board in "iotprojects/Ideationology Lab Board/Sample Photos")**

## What kind of Technologies I am using ? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

**1. Android Studio (Java)<br></br>2. Arduino IDE (Development Board- ESP8266)<br></br>3. Firebase Database.**

## Here are some layouts of the Application.
